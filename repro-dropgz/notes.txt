Background:
- Vipul saw error, when replacing azure-vnet-telemetry.exe, normally with dropgz windows
    - "Process does not have permission"
- Paul j did "mv" and "Rename-Item" just fine using Powershell

Goal:
- Reproduce Vipul's issue, isolated as much as possible
- Try to mimic, either "mv" command or "Rename-Item"
- Also test multiple invocations of our dummy program, while renaming binary for dummy program
